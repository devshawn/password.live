## Overview
Password.live is a web-based password generator written in React, Redux, and Node. The main idea was to create a simple web-based application to generate both simple and complex passwords. The application does not log or store any passwords that are created and is secured by SSL. A docker image is also provided to easily run password.live locally as well.

## Development
Password.live utilizes Lerna & npm for package management. This project is a monorepo, meaning the client and the server are in the same repository. Ensure you have [node/npm][node] installed. Then, install root dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

Dependencies for sub-projects are automatically installed through a postinstall hook running `lerna bootstrap`. You can manually bootstrap all dependencies by running:
```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

### Run the application
Start the client and the server by running:
```bash
npm run serve
```
Visit [localhost:5500][localhost-client] to view the application. The server will be running on [localhost:5501][localhost-server].

### Run tests
To run all tests, run the following in the root directory:
```bash
npm run test
```

To run tests for only the server:
```bash
npm run test:server
```

To run tests for only the client:
```bash
npm run test:client
```

### Building for production
To build the application for production (as it does in our continuous integration builds), run:
```bash
npm run compile
```

To then run the production server (which includes the client), run:
```bash
npm run start
```

The production server will then be running on [localhost:8080][localhost-production].
