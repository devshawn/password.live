## Overview
Password.live is a web-based password generator written in React. The main idea was to create a simple web-based application to generate both simple and complex passwords. The application does not log or store any passwords that are created and is secured by SSL. A docker image is also provided to easily run password.live locally as well.

## Development
Ensure you have [node/npm][node] installed. Then, install dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the application
Start the application by running:
```bash
npm run serve
```
Visit [localhost:8080][localhost] to view the application.

### Run tests
To run all tests, run the following in the root directory:
```bash
npm run test
```

### Building for production
To build the application for production (as it does in our continuous integration builds), run:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a static website which can be viewed using the generated `index.html` file.
